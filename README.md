#Sticky Notes

**Description:**

My sticky note app consists of an input field, a "create" button, and a "delete all" button. To make a note, you put its title into the input field and either hit enter or the create button. A new note will pop up! To edit it, click the pencil icon on the note. The pencil icon will turn into a checkmark; click the check when you're done editing. To delete the note, click the trash icon next to the pencil. To move the note, click the arrows in the top right corner. To resize the note, drag on the bottom right corner. To bring a note to the front, click anywhere on the note.

Getting the z-indexing to work was a bit of a struggle but (with Tim's help!!) I made it work in the end.

**Extra Credit:**

1. zIndex ordering to make a note pop to front when clicked/dragged
2. "Delete all" button
3. Resizeable notes
4. Resizeable textarea when editing notes
5. Notes are nicely formatted
6. Default position of note shifts each time a new one is created, so notes aren't all created on top of one another (make a bunch of notes without moving any of them and you'll see what I mean)
